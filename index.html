<h3 id="Problem-Summary"><a href="#Problem-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Problem Summary"></a>Problem Summary</h3><p>In this project I focused on the texture synthesis and texture transfer problems. Texture synthesis would allow us to generate arbitrary size of texture from a small texture sample, which allows us take sample from real world and generate a proper texture when we do texture mapping. As for texture transfer, we can transfer a “style” of given texture to another image or object.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Previous-Work"><a href="#Previous-Work" class="headerlink" title="Previous Work"></a>Previous Work</h3><p>This topic was raised when image-based rendering being active. A classic texture synthesis and transfer algorithm is image quilting technique<sup>[2]</sup> which is pioneered by Efors and Freeman. Then there is follow-up work of example-based method called optimization-based texture transfer technique. It was firstly proposed by Kwatra. The texture synthesis problem was treated as a global optimization task and used Expectation Maximization-like algorithm to iteratively minimize the energy function. Analogy-based method is another alternative for texture transfer utilizes the availability of the input example pair to acquire the stylized image of target image. For latest research, people proposed Neural-based Style transfer which used pre-trained CNN, they can get a styling context image based on a context image and a style image which would keep the semantic of context image.</p>
<p>In this project, I also used some extend library to create the program. I used Pillow to load and export images. And I used Numpy to accomplish some matrix computation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Description-of-Work"><a href="#Description-of-Work" class="headerlink" title="Description of Work"></a>Description of Work</h3><p>In this project, I first explored multiple texture synthesis and transfer algorithm by reading research papers. Then I decided to implement the one of the fundamental algorithms, image quilting. This algorithm can be utilized in both texture synthesis and texture transfer. And this algorithm also is the basic idea of lots of further work in this area.</p>
<p>In the implementing process, I conducted coding in python. The major challenges in programing were how to properly determine the sample size. Another challenge is how to use dynamic programing to compute the minimal cutting path and paste a new block to the output texture. For the sample size, I paid attention to the boundary of the image, instead of picking a full block from all suitable blocks, the specific size of sample we needed was depends on the remainder size of current location. As for finding the cut path and paste the new block. I used two different masks. After we found the cut path, we would use the path to set these two masks, one used to cut already pasted block, another used to cut the new block.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Result"><a href="#Result" class="headerlink" title="Result"></a>Result</h3><p>I successfully reproduced the image quilting algorithm and was able to use this algorithm to synthesis texture and transfer the texture. I gathered 14 input textures and use the implemented algorithm to generate arbitrary size of output textures. I also used some of these textures to test texture transfer for different photos.</p>
<p>Here were some results for texture synthesis:</p>

<h3 id="Analysis-of-Work"><a href="#Analysis-of-Work" class="headerlink" title="Analysis of Work"></a>Analysis of Work</h3><h4 id="New-Results"><a href="#New-Results" class="headerlink" title="New Results"></a>New Results</h4><p>This project mainly reproduced the paper “Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer”. There were little new results. The program was coded in Python, so it’s easy to read and understand. All the comments were based on the paper. I believe it should be a good material to learn this algorithm and read this paper.</p>
<h4 id="Meeting-Goals"><a href="#Meeting-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Meeting Goals"></a>Meeting Goals</h4><p>I achieved all of the original goals, except the additional one. I successfully implement the texture synthesis and transfer algorithm and built a simple system. For texture synthesis, this system took sample texture as input and users could enter parameters like output texture size, block size and overlap size, then would get synthesized texture. For texture transfer, this system took texture sample and target image as inputs, generated styled target image by given parameters.</p>
<h4 id="Future-Work"><a href="#Future-Work" class="headerlink" title="Future Work"></a>Future Work</h4><p>After doing this project I found the image quilting algorithm has good results in structured textures. However, for unstructured texture, this algorithm didn’t work well. So, for the texture synthesis topic, I would like to explore a way which can generate unstructured texture properly. For texture transfer topic, I noticed “style transfer” was a newer topic in this area, how to use the neural network to find the style of an image and transfer it to another scene would be an interesting topic. Furthermore, instead of transfer static style, how to make the transformation can be interactive with user would also be next direction to head. For example, if it possible for users can lively paint with different styles. </p>

<h3 id="Summary-of-Work-to-Date"><a href="#Summary-of-Work-to-Date" class="headerlink" title="Summary of Work to Date"></a>Summary of Work to Date</h3><p>Firstly, I researched on texture synthesis and transfer algorithms, especially the classic method. Integrate with the paper presentation, I read the paper “Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer” as well as some related work, like “Texture Synthesis by non-parametric Sampling” and “Chaos mosaic: Fast and memory efficient texture synthesis”. After that, I decided to implement the “Image Quilting” algorithm.</p>
<p>Then I found some texture online as input texture. The size of those textures is not too big, one of our goals in this project is implementing the Image Quilting algorithm to generate the arbitrary size of output texture with similar construction. There were 15 different input textures now, most of them were from the image quilting paper.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I started implemented the algorithm in Python. I decided to use the Pillow package to load input texture and export the output. Using NumPy to process matrix computation. As for now, I completed the first two steps of image quilting algorithm: 1) Go through the synthesized texture in raster scan order by step of a block. 2) For each location, randomly pick a block from the input texture that satisfy overlap constraints. What is left is the third step, use dynamic programming to find the minimal cost cut path and paste the new block to the output texture.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Analysis-of-Work"><a href="#Analysis-of-Work" class="headerlink" title="Analysis of Work"></a>Analysis of Work</h3><p>As I listed in the Proposal, there were 4 goals for this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>   Do solid research on texture synthesis and transfer topics. </li>
<li>   Pick at least one example-based texture synthesis and transfer algorithm to implement.</li>
<li>   Build a system to demonstrate the texture synthesis and transfer results.</li>
<li>   (Additional) Explore follow-up texture transfer methods. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now I finished the first goal and the second one is in progress. It’s kind of behind the plan. For the second goal, I have two parts left. For texture synthesis, I need to implement cut path finding function which would utilize dynamic programming. For texture transfer, it still waited to start.</p>
<p>After I finished reproducing the algorithm, I need to design a texture synthesis and transfer pip-line system. In that system, user would give the input texture name, and some parameters, like block size, overlap size, etc. If the user chooses the synthesis model, the system would generate new texture with new size. If the user chooses the transfer model, a context image would be asked, then the system would generate a transfer result.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Plan-for-Completion"><a href="#Plan-for-Completion" class="headerlink" title="Plan for Completion"></a>Plan for Completion</h3><p>The overall goals of this project didn’t change, we would reproduce the Image Quilting algorithm and generate a texture synthesis and transfer system. The updated plan is given below:</p>
<ol>
<li>   Implement the cut path function using dynamic programming. Due Nov. 22</li>
<li>   Implement the texture transfer part. Due Nov.25</li>
<li>   Test all those functions and integrate them as a system. Due Nov. 28</li>
<li>   Start writing the final report, prepare a final presentation from Nov. 30</li>
<li>   (Additional)Explore another algorithm if possible.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><h4 id="Description-of-Problem"><a href="#Description-of-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Description of Problem"></a>Description of Problem</h4><p>In this project I will focus on the texture topic especially texture synthesis and texture transfer problems. In the first assignment we choose some picture as the texture and map to a plane. When the plane is much larger than the texture image, I just simply repeated the image, the plane was divided into separate small textured patch, which makes it looks far-fetched. In this project I’m trying to extend the original texture image, which will make us be able to take a sample of texture and generate an unlimited amount of image data which is not 100% same as original one but will be perceived by human to be the same texture. Furthermore, I’m trying to explore some ways to transfer a texture image to another image or object.</p>
<h4 id="Importance-of-Problem"><a href="#Importance-of-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Problem"></a>Importance of Problem</h4><p>With texture synthesis, we can generate arbitrary size of texture from a small sample. That will allow us take sample from real world and generate a proper texture when we do texture mapping. With texture transfer, we can transfer a “style” of given texture to another image or object. So, we can generate some interesting image, like texture a real-world photo with a paint style or texture a potato with lemon surface.</p>

For texture synthesis, users would give an input sample and can get synthesis texture with arbitrary size. For texture transfer, users would give two input images, one is a style texture, and another is the target image, the output would be a styling target image. The result should be able to demonstrate, and users should be able to input original texture.</p>
